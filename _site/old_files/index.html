			<ul>
				<li> I am a student in the <a href = "https://www.lsa.umich.edu/rc">
				Residential College of the University of Michigan! </a> </li>
				<li> I appreciate a wide variety of Music, from Classical and Baroque to Switched on Bach.
				Brass playing is also high on my list of awesomeness. </li>
				<li> I probably will find some way to relate my studies in college to computers.
				For more on that, see <a href = "Interests/WebDev/index.html"> here</a>
				to see my first webpage ever, a tutorial on HTML, or <a href = "Interests/CS/index.html"> 
				here</a> for more on CS. </li>
				<li> I love:
					<ol> 
					<li>bar trivia/Quiz Bowl/whatever you kids call it these days. My greatest last-minute
					cramming tool is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. </li>
					<li> I am an avid runner, who is just starting out (as of six months ago). My shoes currently
					look like <a href = "images/CAM01539.jpg">this</a>.
					If you have any tips, good routes in A2 or HP, <a href = "mailto:arikrumbein@gmail.com">
					drop me a line.</a></li>
					<li> I procrastinate professionally. We can have coffee someday, if you'd like. </li>
					<li> I love the outdoors (see above) and hiking. </li>
					<li> Any and all of the following: 3D modelling/printing/design/LEGO.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> My resume can be found <a href = "Resume/AriResume.pdf">here</a>.</li>
