## Hi, I'm Ari.

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science in the Residential College at the University of Michigan.

I'm a lifelong learner, always aiming to get my feet wet with something new. Outside of my studies, I enjoy:
<ul>
  <li> trivia</li>
  <li> productivity hacking</li>
  <li> yoga</li>
  <li> being outside</li>
  <li> 3D printing and modeling</li>
  <li> and all sorts of music, from about 1750 onwards. </li>
</ul>

Want to see what I am working on? Check out my <a href='/now'>now </a> page.

If you're interested in making contact, drop me a line.
